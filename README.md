# Iron Lady – AI & Technology Assignment

## Overview

This repository contains two solutions developed as part of the AI & Technology Intern Assignment for Iron Lady.
The objective of this assignment is to design practical, real-world solutions that improve both
customer experience and internal business operations using AI and technology.

---

## Understanding Iron Lady as a Business

Before starting this assignment, I thoroughly explored the Iron Lady website to understand its
business model, offerings, and target audience.

Iron Lady focuses on empowering women through:
- Skill-based programs
- Leadership development
- Career readiness and professional growth

Based on this understanding, the solutions were designed to align with Iron Lady’s real
customer journey and internal workflows.

# Task 1 – AI-Based Customer Interaction Solution
## Iron Lady AI Program Assistant

### Problem Statement

Users visiting the Iron Lady platform often require clarity about available programs,
eligibility criteria, and the application process. Handling these queries manually
can increase response time and reduce user engagement.

---

### Solution Overview

An AI-based Program Assistant was designed to act as a virtual support system.
The assistant interacts with users through a chat interface and provides instant,
conversational guidance related to Iron Lady’s programs and services.

---

### How It Works

- Users interact with the assistant via a chatbot interface
- Users can ask questions such as:
  - What programs are available?
  - What is the application process?
- The AI understands user intent and generates relevant responses in real time

---

### AI Usage and Busy Handling

AI is used to interpret user questions and generate meaningful responses.

In scenarios where the AI service is temporarily unavailable due to high traffic or
rate limits, the application gracefully displays a clear “busy” message instead of
crashing. This ensures reliability and a smooth user experience.

---

### Business Value

- Improves customer experience and engagement
- Reduces dependency on manual support
- Provides instant and consistent information

---

### Tech Stack (Task 1)

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Java (Servlets)
- AI Integration: External AI service (demo environment)
- Server: Apache Tomcat

---

# Task 2 – Internal Business Automation Solution
## Program Management Dashboard

### Problem Statement

Program details are often managed manually using spreadsheets or documents, which can
lead to duplicate entries, outdated information, and increased manual effort.
This reduces operational efficiency.

---

### Solution Overview

An Internal Program Management Dashboard was developed to centralize and automate
program management for Iron Lady’s internal team.

---

### Workflow

1. Admin accesses the internal dashboard
2. Navigates to Program Management
3. Performs the following actions:
   - Create new programs
   - View all programs in a structured table
   - Update program details
   - Delete discontinued programs

---

### Features Implemented

- Complete CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Program status tracking (Active / Inactive)
- Admin-style dashboard UI
- Collapsible sidebar navigation
- Dark / Light mode toggle

---

### Business Value

- Reduces manual work and data duplication
- Improves accuracy of program information
- Saves time for internal teams
- Improves operational efficiency

---

### Tech Stack (Task 2)

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Java (Servlets)
- Architecture: MVC-style separation
- Server: Apache Tomcat

---

## Deployment Note

GitHub hosts only static files.
Backend functionality such as CRUD operations and AI integration is demonstrated locally
using Apache Tomcat and is clearly shown in the demo video.

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates strong business understanding, practical use of AI,
and effective internal business automation.

Both Task 1 and Task 2 are designed to align closely with Iron Lady’s mission
and operational needs, showcasing real-world problem-solving and technical skills.
